### Technologies

1. Use [Netbeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/downloads/)
  * If you use another IDE make sure to update the .gitignore file to only push the src files and not your IDE config files.
2. Use [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
  * This tool is quicker and has more features than PHP My Admin
