### Setup

1. Use [Netbeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/downloads/)
  * If you use another IDE make sure to update the .gitignore file to only push the src files and not your IDE config files.
  * [Netbeans Tutorial on how to setup the project](https://github.com/CSC-429-Group/Library-Application/wiki/How-to-setup-Netbeans-for-this-project)

4. Read [Database Off Campus Tunnel](https://github.com/CSC-429-Group/Library-Application/wiki/Off-Campus-Database---SSH-Tunneling)
5. MUST [Java Library needed to compile](https://github.com/CSC-429-Group/Library-Application/wiki/Java-Libraries-need-to-be-added)
6. MUST Change `server` in `dbConfig.ini` to match `dbConfig_{on/off}campus.ini`.
